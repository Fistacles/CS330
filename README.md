1. How do I approach designing Software?
  When designing software I take a piecemeal approach. I work on one part of the code at a time, ensure that part works functionally through testing, and then move onto
  the next. I find it easiest to work througn like this, as it keeps me from getting bogged down on the entire project when I break it down piece by piece.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
   Much like the first question, I work on one part of the program at a time. I read through the requirements of the program to find what needs to be done and
   through that start building the program bit by bit. Iteration is always a major part of development, particlarly in this course as I would have to use nearly identical
   sets of code to build different images, just moving them about or changing the size and shape. My process of coding has not changed due to the milestones, as it
   followed my current method almost perfectly.

3. How can Computer Science help me in reaching my goals?
   My goal it to pursue a career in programming and computer science teaches me the skills needed to follow that path. I do not plan to use OpenGL or any sort of 3d
   visual program or design in my future, but practicing iteration can help no matter what path in coding one pursues.
